### **# Day 25: Deploy a Static Website on AWS S3 with Terraform**  

#### **Participant Details**  
- **Name:** Yusuf Abdulganiyu  
- **Task Completed:**  
  Today, I focused on deploying a **static website** on **AWS S3** with **CloudFront** using **Terraform**. This project was designed to deepen my understanding of best practices such as using **Terraform modules**, **remote state management**, and **version control**.  

  I also set up a **CloudFront distribution** to ensure fast and secure content delivery for the website, with the added benefit of using **S3** as the origin. This experience reinforced key concepts like **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and **CDN** (Content Delivery Networks) while following best practices for managing both infrastructure and application code.

#### **Activities**  
1. **Reading**  
   - Completed project setup for a static website deployment with **S3** and **CloudFront** using **Terraform**.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
      - Reusability is keyâ€”used **Terraform modules** to make the S3 bucket setup adaptable for other projects.  
      - **Remote state management** with **S3** and **DynamoDB** for state locking to ensure collaboration and consistency.  
      - **Version control** with **Git** to track and manage changes effectively.  

2. **Videos**  
   - Watched tutorials on setting up **AWS S3 for static website hosting** and integrating it with **CloudFront** for secure content delivery.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
      - **CloudFront** serves as a **CDN** to reduce latency and increase performance globally.  
      - Proper configuration of **S3** for public access and security policies is essential for seamless deployment.

3. **Practical Activity**  
   - Deployed the static website on **AWS S3** with **CloudFront** integration for **HTTPS** access.  
   - Set up **remote state management** using **S3** and **DynamoDB**.  
   - Created reusable **Terraform modules** for the **S3 bucket** and **CloudFront distribution**.  
   - Configured **version control** using **Git** for the project setup and changes.

#### **Reflections**  
Todayâ€™s session was a major step in understanding how to deploy static websites in a scalable, efficient, and secure way using **AWS** services and **Terraform**. The integration of **CloudFront** provided a global content delivery network that ensured fast performance and secure delivery. 

This project further solidified my grasp of **best practices** such as **remote state management**, **modular code**, and **version control**, all of which are critical for large-scale infrastructure deployments.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m thrilled with the progress Iâ€™ve made and canâ€™t wait to continue applying these principles to future projects!
