# Day 12: Zero-Downtime Deployment with Terraform

## Participant Details

- **Name:** Otu Michael Udo
- **Task Completed:** Implement zero-downtime infra deployment with terraform using the blue/green strategy. Also wrote a blog post on the blue/green deployment strategy.
- **Date and Time:** 18th December, 2024 | 7:07 PM 

Zero downtime deployments are crucial for maintaining the availability and performance of applications during updates. One effective approach is Blue-Green deployment, where you maintain two environments (Blue and Green) and switch traffic between them without any disruption.

 Key Steps I learned to achieve Zero Downtime Deployments:
 AMI Configuration: One of the first things to do is to ensure the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is exposed as an input variable in variables.tf. This allows you to easily update the AMI for the Blue and Green environments without disrupting the system.
Load Balancer: Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to the active environment, minimizing downtime.
Auto Scaling Groups: Configure separate Auto Scaling Groups for Blue and Green environments, allowing seamless scaling and management of traffic.
Blue-Green Switching: Deploy new versions to the inactive environment, test it, and switch the load balancer to route traffic to it once itâ€™s verified.

This lifecycle rule ensures there is
