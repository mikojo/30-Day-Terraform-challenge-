## Participant Details

- **Name:** Omekwu Victor Ebube  
- **Task Completed:** On Day 7, I deepened my understanding of Terraform state management, focusing on state isolation methods. I configured state isolation using both Workspaces and file layouts, ensuring separate environments for different stages (e.g., dev, staging, production). Additionally, I explored remote state storage and state locking for team environments, utilizing services for secure state management and preventing conflicts.
