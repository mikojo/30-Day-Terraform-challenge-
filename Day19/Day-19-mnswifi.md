# Day 19: Adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Your Team

## Participant Details

- **Name:** Yusuf Abdulganiyu  
- **Task Completed:**
1. Reading
Chapter: Start reading Chapter 10 of "Terraform: Up & Running"
Section: "Adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in Your Team".

2. Videos
Udemy: Watch the following videos from Section 12:
"HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Getting Started" (Video 67)
"HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Remote State" (Video 68)
"HCP Terraform (Terraform Cloud) - Workspaces" (Video 69)

3. Activity
Adopting IaC:
Reflect on your own team's infrastructure management process. Create a plan for how you would propose adopting Infrastructure as Code in your team.
Break this plan down into incremental steps to avoid overwhelming your team, and outline how you would give them the time to learn.

## Plan for Adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

1. Assess Current State: Review the existing infrastructure management process and identify pain points and manual inefficiencies.

2. Set Clear Goals: Define measurable outcomes for adopting IaC, such as faster deployments, improved consistency, and reduced downtime.

3. Build Team Buy-In: Educate the team on IaC's benefits through workshops, emphasizing mindset shifts and aligning with modern trends.

4. Pilot Small Projects: Start with non-critical infrastructure to implement IaC using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation, focusing on learning.

5. Upskill the Team: Provide hands-on training and certifications, ensuring everyone understands IaC principles and syntax.

6. Implement Incremental Adoption:

  - Phase 1: Automate infrastructure for one application using Blue-Green or Canary strategies to minimize disruption.
  - Phase 2: Expand to other environments incrementally.
  - Phase 3: Fully integrate IaC into CI/CD pipelines.
7. Feedback and Iteration: Regularly review adoption progress, address skills gaps, and iterate the process.

8. Monitor and Optimize: Leverage monitoring tools to measure success and refine IaC workflows for scalability and resilience.
