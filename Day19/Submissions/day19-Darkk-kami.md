## Plan for Adopting IaC  

### Incremental Steps  
1. **Start Small:** Identify one app or process to migrate, such as automating a problematic deployment with Terraform.  
2. **Deliver Value Early:** Focus on solutions that provide immediate benefits, like reducing outages or improving deployment speed.  
3. **Quick Wins:** Use successes to build momentum and encourage other teams to adopt IaC gradually.  

### Learning Time  
- Provide training resources: documentation, video tutorials, and hands-on workshops.  
- Allocate time for team members to practice Terraform workflows during regular work hours.  
- Foster collaboration by pairing experienced team members with those still learning.  

### Convincing Leadership  
- Highlight the risks of manual processes: downtime, human errors, and inefficiency.  
- Emphasize the scalability, reliability, and cost savings of IaC.  
- Show tangible quick wins, such as reduced deployment time or fewer outages, to build trust and support.  

## Outcome  
This plan ensures a smooth, sustainable IaC adoption process by delivering value incrementally, empowering the team through learning, and gaining leadership buy-in.
