Adopting IaC can revolutionize your infrastructure management, however, convincing your team to buy into the idea is essential. 
Hereâ€™s how:
When pitching IaC to your boss, focus on the problems it solves rather than the technical features it offers. Identify key pain points, such as:
Frequent outages caused by manual errors.
Difficulty scaling infrastructure efficiently.
Slow deployment processes, hindering innovation.

Then, demonstrate how IaC addresses these issues directly. For instance:
Automation: IaC reduces manual errors, minimizing outages.
Instead of overhauling all infrastructure at once, start small and solve specific, visible problems to deliver value at every step.
