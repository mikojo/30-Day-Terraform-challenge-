## Additional Notes  
I shared my personal story and learning goals in my first blog post on Medium: [Why I Chose to Learn Terraform](https://medium.com/@mnourdine/why-i-chose-to-learn-terraform-my-30-day-challenge-with-hashicorp-user-group-yaounde-3b0f2324b4c6). Writing this helped me reflect on the challenges I faced with manual infrastructure management and the transformative potential of Terraform and IaC in DevOps. Looking forward to the next steps in this journey!
