understanding what Terraform is and why it's important in the context of Infrastructure as Code 
(IaC).

2. **Udemy Videos**: 
   - Watched videos 1 to 6 covering the basics of Terraform and its integration with AWS. This 
helped in solidifying the concept of infrastructure automation and preparing for hands-on setup.

3. **Activity**:
   - **AWS Account Setup**: Successfully set up an AWS account.
   - **Terraform Installation**: Installed Terraform locally and verified its functionality by 
running the `terraform --version` command.
   - **AWS CLI Installation**: Installed AWS CLI and configured it using `aws configure` with my AWS 
credentials.
   - **VSCode Installation**: Installed Visual Studio Code and added the AWS plugin to manage 
infrastructure deployments.
   - **VSCode Configuration**: Configured VSCode to work seamlessly with AWS by ensuring the AWS CLI 
and Terraform extensions are enabled.

4. **Blog Post**:  
   - **Title**: "What is IaC and Its Benefits"  
     I wrote and published a blog post detailing the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and its 
benefits, such as version control for infrastructure, improved consistency, and faster deployments.

5. **Social Media Post**:  
   - Shared my progress on social media:  
     "ðŸ’» Just installed Terraform, AWS CLI, and configured my AWS environment with VSCode. Ready to 
deploy some infrastructure! #TerraformSetup #AWS #DevOps"

### Deliverables:
- Completed daily-update.md file documenting the task and progress.
- Published a blog post on the benefits of IaC.
- Shared the progress on social media with the required hashtags.

**Looking forward to building more infrastructure tomorrow!**
