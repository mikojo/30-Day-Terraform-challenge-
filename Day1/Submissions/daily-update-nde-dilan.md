# Day 1: Introduction to Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
🚀 Day 1 of 30 Days of Terraform! 🌍
Hi everyone, it's Dilan 🤓! 

## Participant Details

- **Name:** NDE HURICH DILAN



- **Task Completed:** Introduction to Terraform and IaC
- **Date and Time:** 01nd Dec 2024 


## Additional Notes

- I learnt about the Rise of DevOps 
- The importance of IAC
- How Terraform works in general
- How Terraform operates in comparison with other IAC tools

Today I kicked off my hashtag#Terraform journey with the basics:

## 👉 What's DevOps?
From two separate teams 🧑‍💻👷 to a collaborative, efficient process powered by CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing). DevOps bridges the gap with a circular workflow and continuous deployment. 💡

## 👉 What's IaC (Infrastructure as Code)?
Think of IaC as writing code 📝 to define your cloud infrastructure! With tools like Terraform, you can automate server setups, databases, and more! No more manual configurations—just write, test, and deploy! 🚀
