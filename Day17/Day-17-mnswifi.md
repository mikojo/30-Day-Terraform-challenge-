	- Continued with the terraform deployment of multi-apigateway, where i continously show cased the understanding of terraform providers,
    Using providers within a modules, desigining and implementing production grade deployment, and lastly, manual testing.
   - Manual Testing: Choose an existing Terraform configuration and perform manual tests on it. This could include:
   - Verifying that resources are created correctly.
