#### Activities:
1. **Configurable Web Server**: We deployed a web server using input variables to define properties such as instance size, AMI, and tags dynamically.
2. **Clustered Web Server**: A significant milestone was deploying a highly available web application using multiple EC2 instances across availability zones for redundancy and reliability.
3. **Documentation Exploration**: Diving into Terraform's documentation provided deeper insights into providers, resource blocks, and workflows, reinforcing our understanding of the foundational concepts.

#### Takeaways:
The experience was both challenging and rewarding. Deploying a highly available setup underscored the importance of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in modern development practices. The journey ahead looks promising as we continue pushing the boundaries of automation with Terraform!
