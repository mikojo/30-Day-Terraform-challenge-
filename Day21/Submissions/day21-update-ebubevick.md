Today, I successfully completed the task of simulating a workflow for deploying infrastructure code using Terraform Cloud. Notably, I had already gone above and beyond by tackling this task during Day 20. During that process, I integrated version control with GitHub, explored Terraform Cloud features like secure variables, and documented the workflow in a markdown file. Revisiting the task today gave me the opportunity to refine my approach, ensuring a deeper understanding of deploying infrastructure code efficiently and effectively.

The task involved setting up a seamless workflow that combines Terraform Cloud and GitHub for version control, enabling better collaboration and tracking of infrastructure changes. By using Terraform Cloud's secure variables, I ensured sensitive information remained protected throughout the process. Additionally, I explored the use of Terraform Cloudâ€™s private registry, which helps streamline the reuse of infrastructure modules across projects. Completing this task has further enhanced my confidence in managing infrastructure as code and deploying it in a secure, scalable manner.
