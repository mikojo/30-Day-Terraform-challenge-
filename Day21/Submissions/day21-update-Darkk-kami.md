# Day 21 Submission: Infrastructure Code Deployment with Terraform

- Set up the GitHub repository and pushed the Terraform code, ensuring version control for the infrastructure configurations.
- Integrated GitHub with Terraform Cloud to automate infrastructure deployment and streamline the workflow.
- Configured AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) in Terraform Cloud workspace to enable seamless authentication during the Terraform runs.
- Pushed updates to the GitHub repository, triggering a Terraform run that automatically applied the infrastructure changes in the cloud environment, ensuring consistency and repeatability of deployments.
- Verified infrastructure deployment by checking Terraform Cloudâ€™s run outputs to confirm that the desired cloud resources were provisioned correctly.
