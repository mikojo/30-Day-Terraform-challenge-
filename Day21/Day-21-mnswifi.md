# Day 21: Workflow for Deploying Infrastructure Code

## Participant Details

- **Name:Yusuf Abdulganiyu 
- **Task Completed:
    - Today, I focused on mastering the workflow for deploying infrastructure code,
     which involves managing resources like databases, load balancers, and network configurations.
     I simulated the seven-step workflow outlined in Terraform: Up & Running, applying version control to track changes,
     testing configurations locally, and automating deployments to ensure efficient infrastructure updates. Additionally,
     I explored Terraform Cloud's private registry to securely store and share infrastructure modules.
     These activities provided a practical understanding of managing infrastructure as code (IaC),
     leveraging version control for collaboration, and utilizing Terraform Cloud for streamlined and secure infrastructure deployments.

  Activity
    - Simulated the seven-step workflow for deploying infrastructure code from Terraform: Up & Running, focusing on version control, local testing, and automated deployments.
    - Applied version control to manage infrastructure code and track changes effectively.
    - Tested infrastructure configurations locally to ensure accuracy before deployment.
    - Automated the deployment process for infrastructure updates, streamlining efficiency.
    - Explored Terraform Cloud's private registry to securely store and share reusable infrastructure modules.
