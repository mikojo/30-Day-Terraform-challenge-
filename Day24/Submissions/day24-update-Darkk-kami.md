## Simulated Practice Exam  
To prepare effectively, I simulated a real exam environment by:  
1. Setting a 60-minute timer to mimic exam time constraints.  
2. Used sample questions that addressed a range of subjects, from simple CLI instructions to intricate infrastructure situations.  
3. Avoided external resources during the practice to replicate actual exam conditions.
