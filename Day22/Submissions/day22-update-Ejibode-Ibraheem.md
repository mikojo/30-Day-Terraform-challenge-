- My experience  with this 30 days challenge reflects a systematic and thorough approach to learning Terraform, from the basics to advanced, production-ready configurations. I have consistently demonstrated an ability to integrate Terraform with various AWS services, adopt best practices, and share my knowledge with people on different platforms such as Linkedn, and dev.to. I have also helped some struggling colleagues during the course of this training.I can't wait to implement my skills in a real world scenerio.
