### **# Day 22: Integrating Application and Infrastructure Code Workflows**

#### **Participant Details**  
- **Name:** Yusuf Abdulganiyu  
- **Task Completed:**  
  Today, I dove deep into the final chapter of *Terraform: Up & Running* and focused on combining workflows for deploying both application and infrastructure code.
  This exercise brought together the key concepts of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices to create a seamless, automated, and secure deployment pipeline.  
 
  I also explored the implementation of Sentinel policies within Terraform Cloud to enforce security and compliance. By integrating these workflows,
  I gained a practical understanding of managing both application and infrastructure changes in a version-controlled and scalable manner.  

#### **Activities**  
1. **Reading**  
   - Completed Chapter 10: "Putting It All Together" in *Terraform: Up & Running*.  
   - **Key Takeaways:**  
      - Use version control for both application and infrastructure code to maintain a single source of truth.  
      - Promote immutable, versioned artifacts across environments to ensure consistency and rollback capability.  
      - Automate testing and deployment through CI pipelines to improve reliability.  

2. **Videos**  
   - Completed Udemy Section 12:  
     - *HCP Terraform - Sentinel Policy*: Learned how to use policies to enforce compliance.  
     - *HCP Terraform - VCS Workflow*: Explored the benefits of version-controlled workflows in Terraform Cloud.  

3. **Practical Activity**  
   - Integrated workflows for deploying both application and infrastructure code.  
   - Implemented version control for managing changes to both types of code.  
   - Applied Sentinel policies to enforce security and compliance in the CI/CD pipeline.  

#### **Reflections**  
Todayâ€™s session tied together everything Iâ€™ve learned over the past 21 days. The most rewarding part was realizing how Terraform supports an end-to-end workflow for managing modern infrastructure and applications. 
Combining IaC with application code workflows provides the agility needed to deliver reliable, secure, and scalable solutions in real-world environments.  

ðŸš€ Completing this chapter feels like a significant milestone in my Terraform journey, but Iâ€™m excited to continue honing these skills with hands-on projects. The learning never stops!

#### **Additional Notes**  
- Integrated Terraform into real-world DevOps workflows.  
- Understood the importance of immutability and versioning for reliable deployments.  
- Appreciated the role of compliance policies in securing workflows.
