# Day 20: Workflow for Deploying Application Code

## Participant Details

- **Name:Yusuf Abdulganiyu 
- **Task Completed:
    - Today, I focused on mastering the workflow for deploying application code, simulating a complete DevOps process from development to production.
      This included integrating a GitHub repository with Terraform Cloud for automated deployments, securing sensitive variables to protect critical data,
      and utilizing Terraform Cloud's private registry to store and share reusable modules. By following the seven-step workflow outlined in Terraform: Up & Running,
      I gained practical experience in version control, securing configurations, and leveraging Terraform Cloud features.
      These activities provided a comprehensive understanding of deploying application code effectively and securely,
      setting the stage for comparing this workflow with infrastructure code deployments in the coming days.
