## Revision plan
Struggled with state management, particularly with remote backends and state locking, and had difficulty managing module dependencies and organizing reusable modules. 
To address these gaps, I plan to
- Review concepts of remote state backends.
- Additionally, I'll practice creating and using reusable modules, revisiting module versioning and managing dependencies and state effectively.
